            Dear Neighbour,
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe in small things with big meaning. The way a local shop
            feels like home. The way a handwritten note can say more than a
            billboard ever could. We believe in showing up for each other in the
            hard moments and the hopeful ones, because thatâ€™s how strong
            communities are built.
            <br />
            <br />
            The three of us met in school, but what connected us was bigger than
            design. We kept coming back to the same conversations: how to
            support others, how to create space for underrepresented voices, how
            to build something that gives back.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thatâ€™s what dear neighbour is really about!
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe in collaboration over competition. In lifting each other
            up. In making things with heart, not ego.
            <br />
            <br />
            And most of all, we believe that when we care for our communities,
            they care for us right back.
          </p>
